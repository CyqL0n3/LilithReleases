The Lilith Overlay is without a doubt the best general-purpose utility overlay available for Hypixel, now in early alpha testing.

## Duels Stats
Remember Seraph? Well now you can forget about it. Lilith features queuestats that tell you exactly what you need to know for dodging, while ignoring bots and updating you on who's nicked.
Lilith also has name deobfuscation in chat, tablist, and nametags, and adapts what duels mode stats are checked for based off of the gamemode you're currently playing.

## Requeue Command
Are you tired of having to remember play commands or exit to lobby? That's why Lilith has a requeue command. Just do `/rq` and you'll be put into a new game.

## Cooldown Protection
Don't lose winstreaks to "You are sending too many commands." Lilith will kick you to the blitz lobby for optimal speed when `/rq` or a play command doesn't work, and will automatically redirect you to wherever you wanted to go. This also happens when doing `/l` in a game.
